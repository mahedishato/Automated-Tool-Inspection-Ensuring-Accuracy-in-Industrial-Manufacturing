**Overview**  
The Automated Tool Inspection System is a cutting-edge solution designed to bring speed, accuracy, and efficiency to quality control in industrial tool manufacturing. By harnessing the power of AI, this system automates the detection and counting of tools in production boxes, minimizing the need for manual inspection and significantly reducing the potential for costly errors and delays.

### Problem Statement

In high-demand manufacturing environments, verifying that every tool is present and correctly accounted for in production boxes is critical. Traditional manual inspections are not only time-intensive but also prone to human error. Misplaced or missing tools can disrupt the manufacturing line, lead to rework, and negatively impact customer satisfaction.

### Solution

Our system integrates real-time image processing with advanced machine learning to provide a fully automated, precise solution for tool inspection. This approach reduces human error, accelerates inspection, and ensures that the production line flows smoothly.

## How It Works

1. **Image Capture**  
   A high-quality camera captures images of the tools in each production box.

2. **Tool Detection and Classification**  
   Using YOLOx and the custom CNN model, each tool in the image is detected and classified, comparing the observed count to the expected count.

3. **Real-Time Feedback**  
   Any discrepancies are flagged immediately, allowing operators to address issues before they become a problem further down the line.

4. **Data Logging**  
   The system logs data on each inspection, providing actionable insights on tool inventory and potential areas for operational improvement.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**  
   Ensure that YOLOx and the required dependencies are installed. Refer to the [YOLOx installation guide](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX) for setup instructions.

2. **Configuration**  
   Configure the system to recognize the specific tools in your production line by training the CNN model on your dataset.

3. **Deployment**  
   Deploy the system on your production line. The setup guide will walk you through camera positioning, calibration, and software integration.

4. **Training New Tools**  
   If new tools need to be added, simply retrain the model with the updated dataset.
